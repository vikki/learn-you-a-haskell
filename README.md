## Haskell Learnings

This is me learning haskell, using [learnyouahaskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com), which is brilliant.

## Notable bits
### [monkeyisland_insult_swordfighting.hs](https://github.com/vikki/learn-you-a-haskell/blob/master/monkeyisland_insult_swordfighting.hs)
The [Insult Sword Fighting](http://monkeyisland.wikia.com/wiki/Insult_Sword_Fighting) 
from Monkey Island (the best game ever) in Haskell-ised command line form. 
For no good reason other than the game's ace, and I was learning IO in Haskell.
