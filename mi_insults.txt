Insult: This is the END for you, you gutter-crawling cur!
Comeback: And I've got a little TIP for you, get the POINT?
Insult: Soon you'll be wearing my sword like a shish kebab!
Comeback: First you better stop waiving it like a feather-duster.
Insult: My handkerchief will wipe up your blood!
Comeback: So you got that job as janitor, after all.
Insult: People fall at my feet when they see me coming.
Comeback: Even BEFORE they smell your breath?
Insult: I once owned a dog that was smarter then you.
Comeback: He must have taught you everything you know.
Insult: You make me want to puke.
Comeback: You make me think somebody already did.
Insult: Nobody's ever drawn blood from me and nobody ever will.
Comeback: You run THAT fast?
Insult: You fight like a dairy farmer.
Comeback: How appropriate. You fight like a cow.
Insult: I got this scar on my face during a mighty struggle!
Comeback: I hope now you've learned to stop picking your nose.
Insult: Have you stopped wearing diapers yet?
Comeback: Why, did you want to borrow one?
Insult: I've heard you were a contemptible sneak.
Comeback: Too bad no one's ever heard of YOU at all.
Insult: You're no match for my brains, you poor fool.
Comeback: I'd be in real trouble if you ever used them.
Insult: You have the manners of a beggar.
Comeback: I wanted to make sure you'd feel comfortable with me.
Insult: I'm not going to take your insolence sitting down!
Comeback: Your hemorrhoids are flaring up again, eh?
Insult: There are no words for how disgusting you are.
Comeback: Yes there are. You just never learned them.
Insult: I've spoken with apes more polite then you.
Comeback: I'm glad to hear you attended your family reunion.
